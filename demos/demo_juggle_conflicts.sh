editing the same line:"

run_command "jj diff -r first"
run_command "jj diff -r second"
run_command "jj diff -r third"

comment "Let's reorder the second and third commits:"
run_command "jj rebase -s third -d first"
run_command "jj rebase -s second -d third"
run_command "jj log"
comment "The commit labeled \"third\" has a conflict, as expected. What's more
interesting is that the top commit has no conflict! That's because it
has the changes from all three commits applied to it.

Let's verify that by looking at its contents:"
run_command "jj co second"
run_command "cat file"

comment "Let's now instead make \"second\" and \"third\"
sibling and merge them:"
run_command "jj rebase -s second -d first"
run_command "jj merge second third -m merged"
run_command "jj log"
comment "Again, because the merge commit has the
changes from all three commits, it has no
conflict."
