# NOTE ON TOOLS: the only two nice tools I'm aware of that support our use-case
# (non-animated svgs) are https://github.com/slowli/term-transcript and
# https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/AnsiToImg. They have slightly different
# limitations and advantages. If one of them stops being developed, we could
# look at the other one.
#
# AnsiToImg can also generate PNGs, but that is currently harder to setup than
# `convert`. `convert` supports different backends. I do not completely
# understand them. On Debian, it did not work well without `sudo apt install
# inkscape`. It's unclear to me whether `convert` used Inkscape or one of its
# dependencies. Inkscape can be also used manually for SVG -> PNG conversion.
