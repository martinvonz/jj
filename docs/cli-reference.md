!!! warning

    This CLI reference is experimental. It is automatically generated, but
    does not match the `jj help` output exactly.

    Run `jj help <COMMAND>` for more authoritative documentation.

    For example, each argument for each command will show only one
    paragraph of documentation on this page, even if `jj help` would
    show multiple paragraphs with additional details.
