# Jujutsu—a version control system

## Welcome to `jj`'s documentation website!

<!-- This only applies to the website, not to the GitHub interface -->
The complete list of the available documentation pages is located in
the sidebar on the left of the page. The sidebar may be hidden; if so,
you can open it either by widening your browser window or by clicking
on the hamburger menu that appears in this situation.

Additional help is available using the `jj help` command if you have
`jj` installed.

You may want to jump to:

- Documentation for the [latest released version of `jj`](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest).
- Documentation for the [unreleased version of `jj`](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/prerelease). This version of the docs corresponds to the `main` branch of the `jj` repo.
