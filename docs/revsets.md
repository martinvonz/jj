# Revsets

Jujutsu supports a functional language for selecting a set of revisions.
Expressions in this language are called "revsets" (the idea comes from
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/help/revsets)). The language
consists of symbols, operators, and functions.

Most `jj` commands accept a revset (or multiple). Many commands, such as
`jj diff -r <revset>` expect the revset to resolve to a single commit; it is
an error to pass a revset that resolves to more than one commit (or zero
commits) to such commands.

The words "revisions" and "commits" are used interchangeably in this document.

Most revsets search only the [visible commits](glossary.md#visible-commits).
Other commits are only included if you explicitly mention them (e.g. by commit
ID or a Git ref pointing to them).

## Symbols

The `@` expression refers to the working copy commit in the current workspace.
Use `<workspace name>@` to refer to the working-copy commit in another
workspace. Use `<name>@<remote>` to refer to a remote-tracking branch.

A full commit ID refers to a single commit. A unique prefix of the full commit
ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique prefix.

A full change ID refers to all visible commits with that change ID (there is
typically only one visible commit with a given change ID). A unique prefix of
the full change ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique prefix.

Use [single or double quotes][string-literals] to prevent a symbol from being
interpreted as an expression. For example, `"x-"` is the symbol `x-`, not the
parents of symbol `x`. Taking shell quoting into account, you may need to use
something like `jj log -r '"x-"'`.

### Priority

Jujutsu attempts to resolve a symbol in the following order:

1. Tag name
2. Branch name
3. Git ref
4. Commit ID or change ID

## Operators

The following operators are supported. `x` and `y` below can be any revset, not
only symbols.

- `x & y`: Revisions that are in both `x` and `y`.
- `x | y`: Revisions that are in either `x` or `y` (or both).
- `x ~ y`: Revisions that are in `x` but not in `y`.
- `~x`: Revisions that are not in `x`.
- `x-`: Parents of `x`.
- `x+`: Children of `x`.
- `::x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself.
- `x::`: Descendants of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself.
- `x::y`: Descendants of `x` that are also ancestors of `y`. Equivalent
  to `x:: & ::y`. This is what `git log` calls `--ancestry-path x..y`.
- `::`: All visible commits in the repo. Equivalent to `all()`.
- `x..y`: Ancestors of `y` that are not also ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to
  `::y ~ ::x`. This is what `git log` calls `x..y` (i.e. the same as we call it).
- `..x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself, but excluding
  the root commit. Equivalent to `::x ~ root()`.
- `x..`: Revisions that are not ancestors of `x`.
- `..`: All visible commits in the repo, but excluding the root commit.
  Equivalent to `~root()`.

You can use parentheses to control evaluation order, such as `(x & y) | z` or
`x & (y | z)`.

## Functions

You can also specify revisions by using functions. Some functions take other
revsets (expressions) as arguments.

- `parents(x)`: Same as `x-`.

- `children(x)`: Same as `x+`.

- `ancestors(x[, depth])`: `ancestors(x)` is the same as `::x`.
  `ancestors(x, depth)` returns the ancestors of `x` limited to the given
  `depth`.

- `descendants(x)`: Same as `x::`.

- `reachable(srcs, domain)`: All commits reachable from `srcs` within
  `domain`, traversing all parent and child edges.

- `connected(x)`: Same as `x::x`. Useful when `x` includes several commits.

- `all()`: All visible commits in the repo.

- `none()`: No commits. This function is rarely useful; it is provided for
  completeness.

- `branches([pattern])`: All local branch targets. If `pattern` is specified,
  this selects the branches whose name match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `branches(push)` would match the
  branches `push-123` and `repushed` but not the branch `main`. If a branch is
  in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

- `remote_branches([branch_pattern[, [remote=]remote_pattern]])`: All remote
  branch targets across all remotes. If just the `branch_pattern` is
  specified, the branches whose names match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns) across all remotes are selected. If both
  `branch_pattern` and `remote_pattern` are specified, the selection is
  further restricted to just the remotes whose names match `remote_pattern`.

  For example, `remote_branches(push, ri)` would match the branches
  `push-123@origin` and `repushed@private` but not `push-123@upstream` or
  `main@origin` or `main@upstream`. If a branch is in a conflicted state, all
  its possible targets are included.

  While Git-tracking branches can be selected by `<name>@git`, these branches
  aren't included in `remote_branches()`.

- `tags()`: All tag targets. If a tag is in a conflicted state, all its
  possible targets are included.

- `git_refs()`: All Git ref targets as of the last import. If a Git ref
  is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

- `git_head()`: The Git `HEAD` target as of the last import. Equivalent to
  `present(HEAD@git)`.

- `visible_heads()`: All visible heads (same as `heads(all())`).

- `root()`: The virtual commit that is the oldest ancestor of all other commits.

- `heads(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not ancestors of other commits in `x`.
  Note that this is different from
  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `heads(x)`
  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x-`.

- `roots(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not descendants of other commits in `x`.
  Note that this is different from
  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `roots(x)`
  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x+`.

- `latest(x[, count])`: Latest `count` commits in `x`, based on committer
  timestamp. The default `count` is 1.

- `merges()`: Merge commits.

- `description(pattern)`: Commits that have a description matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

- `author(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name or email matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

- `mine()`: Commits where the author's email matches the email of the current
  user.

- `committer(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's name or email matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns).

- `empty()`: Commits modifying no files. This also includes `merges()` without
  user modifications and `root()`.

- `file(pattern[, pattern]...)`: Commits modifying paths matching one of the
  given [file patterns](filesets.md#file-patterns).

  Paths are relative to the directory `jj` was invoked from. A directory name
  will match all files in that directory and its subdirectories.

  For example, `file(foo)` will match files `foo`, `foo/bar`, `foo/bar/baz`.
  It will _not_ match `foobar` or `bar/foo`.

- `conflict()`: Commits with conflicts.

- `present(x)`: Same as `x`, but evaluated to `none()` if any of the commits
  in `x` doesn't exist (e.g. is an unknown branch name.)

- `working_copies()`: The working copy commits across all the workspaces.

## String patterns

Functions that perform string matching support the following pattern syntax:

- `"string"`, or `string` (the quotes are optional), or `substring:"string"`:
  Matches strings that contain `string`.
- `exact:"string"`: Matches strings exactly equal to `string`.
- `glob:"pattern"`: Matches strings with Unix-style shell [wildcard
  `pattern`](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html).

## Aliases

New symbols and functions can be defined in the config file, by using any
combination of the predefined symbols/functions and other aliases.

For example:

```toml
[revset-aliases]
'HEAD' = '@-'
'user(x)' = 'author(x) | committer(x)'
```

### Built-in Aliases

The following aliases are built-in and used for certain operations. These functions
are defined as aliases in order to allow you to overwrite them as needed.
See [revsets.toml](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/revsets.toml)
for a comprehensive list.

- `trunk()`: Resolves to the head commit for the trunk branch of the remote
  named `origin` or `upstream`. The branches `main`, `master`, and `trunk` are
  tried. If more than one potential trunk commit exists, the newest one is
  chosen. If none of the branches exist, the revset evaluates to `root()`.

  You can [override](./config.md) this as appropriate. If you do, make sure it
  always resolves to exactly one commit. For example:

  ```toml
  [revset-aliases]
  'trunk()' = 'your-branch@your-remote'
  ```

- `immutable_heads()`: Resolves to `trunk() | tags()` by default. See
  [here](config.md#set-of-immutable-commits) for details.

- `immutable()`: The set of commits that `jj` treats as immutable. This is
  equivalent to `::(immutable_heads() | root())`. Note that modifying this will
  _not_ change whether a commit is immutable. To do that, edit
  `immutable_heads()`.

- `mutable()`: The set of commits that `jj` treats as mutable. This is
  equivalent to `~immutable()`. Note that modifying this will
  _not_ change whether a commit is immutable. To do that, edit
  `immutable_heads()`.

## The `all:` modifier

Certain commands (such as `jj rebase`) can take multiple revset arguments, and
each of these may resolve to one-or-many revisions. By default, `jj` will not
allow revsets that resolve to more than one revision &mdash; a so-called "large
revset" &mdash; and will ask you to confirm that you want to proceed by
prefixing it with the `all:` modifier.

If you set the `ui.always-allow-large-revsets` option to `true`, `jj` will
behave as though the `all:` modifier was used every time it would matter.

An `all:` modifier before a revset expression does not otherwise change its
meaning. Strictly speaking, it is not part of the revset language. The notation
is similar to the modifiers like `glob:` allowed before [string
patterms](#string-patterns).

For example, `jj rebase -r w -d xyz+` will rebase `w` on top of the child of
`xyz` as long as `xyz` has exactly one child.

If `xyz` has more than one child, the `all:` modifier is _not_ specified, and
`ui.always-allow-large-revsets` is `false` (the default), `jj rebase -r w -d
xyz+` will return an error.

If `ui.always-allow-large-revsets` was `true`, the above command would act as if
`all:` was set (see the next paragraph).

With the `all:` modifier, `jj rebase -r w -d all:xyz+` will make `w` into a merge
commit if `xyz` has more than one child. The `all:` modifier confirms that the
user expected `xyz` to have more than one child.

A more useful example: if `w` is a merge commit, `jj rebase -s w -d all:w- -d
xyz` will add `xyz` to the list of `w`'s parents.

## Examples

Show the parent(s) of the working-copy commit (like `git log -1 HEAD`):

```
jj log -r @-
```

Show all ancestors of the working copy (like plain `git log`)

```
jj log -r ::@
```

Show commits not on any remote branch:

```
jj log -r 'remote_branches()..'
```

Show commits not on `origin` (if you have other remotes like `fork`):

```
jj log -r 'remote_branches(remote=origin)..'
```

Show the initial commits in the repo (the ones Git calls "root commits"):

```
jj log -r root()+
```

Show some important commits (like `git --simplify-by-decoration`):

```
jj log -r 'tags() | branches()'
```

Show local commits leading up to the working copy, as well as descendants of
those commits:

```
jj log -r '(remote_branches()..@)::'
```

Show commits authored by "martinvonz" and containing the word "reset" in the
description:

```
jj log -r 'author(martinvonz) & description(reset)'
```
