# This workflow pushes docs rendered by docs-preview-build.yml to
# https://github.com/jj-preview/docs.
#
# There, GitHub's own "deploy pages" action will run to publish the static files
# to https://jj-preview.github.io/docs/. This adds a 30s delay before the docs
# are actually published/updated.
#
# jj-preview/docs has a top-level .nojekyll file. Otherwise GitHub will try
# rendering with Jekyll, and the delay will be longer.
#
# We use a separate repo for two reasons:
#   1. No chance to accidentally mess up the main GH Pages
#   2. Avoid the impression that the published content is "official"
