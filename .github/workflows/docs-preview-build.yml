# This workflow builds the docs for each PR, and uploads the rendered docs as an
# artifact.
#
# The artifact will be picked up by docs-preview-deploy.yml and published at
# https://jj-preview.github.io/docs/pr-<number>.
#
# The split into "build" and "deploy" follows GitHub's guide at
# https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/.
# The build workflow has no access to the deploy key. The deploy workflow has
# access, but is only allowed to run from the main branch (by requesting the
# 'preview' environment).
